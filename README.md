# GAIA

The personification of Mother Nature, GAIA was the core of Project Zero Dawn. Capable of making the trillions<br>
of calculations required to control the terraforming systems autonomously, GAIA's primary function was code-breaking<br>
to deactivate the Faro Swarm and overseeing operations to make the Earth eventually come back to life. GAIA's main<br>
computer core was housed in GAIA Prime, a massive bunker holding all computer systems needed to manage the task.<br>
GAIA was assisted by nine sub-components each dedicated to a single task.

## Sub-functions

### AETHER

AETHER is the subfunction dedicated to detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere.

### APOLLO

APOLLO is the subfunction dedicated to the archival of human history and culture, and the education of new generations<br>
of humans born in Cradle facilities.

### ARTEMIS

ARTEMIS is the subfunction dedicated to the creation and reintroduction of animal life onto a newly-terraformed Earth.

### DEMETER

DEMETER is the subfunction dedicated to the replanting of the Earth from cryo-preserved seed stocks.

### ELEUTHIA

ELEUTHIA is the subfunction dedicated to the cloning and raising of humans from genetic stock at specially designed and<br>
prepared Cradle facilities scattered across the Earth.

### HADES

HADES is the "extinction failsafe protocol" -- the last resort for GAIA, which would allow it to destroy and reset the<br>
terraforming process when an undesirable outcome is detected.

### HEPHESTUS

HEPHAESTUS is the subfunction dedicated to the construction of underground Cauldron facilities that would build the<br>
machines needed to complete the terraforming project.

### MINERVA

MINERVA is the subfunction dedicated to the construction of massive communications arrays to broadcast the deactivation<br>
codes to the berserk Faro robots.

### POSEIDON

POSEIDON is the subfunction dedicated to detoxifying the Earth's poisoned seas and oceans.

This is just a fun little thing bases on the game [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn)
